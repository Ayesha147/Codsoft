TASK1: Password generator
The Password Generator is a Python-based tool designed to generate strong, secure, and customizable passwords. 
This project leverages Python's capabilities to create a utility that helps users produce passwords that are robust against
various types of attacks while also being adaptable to specific user needs.
Key Features
Customizable Password Length: Users can specify the length of the password to fit their security requirements, from a minimum length to an extended maximum length.
Character Set Options: The generator can include or exclude various types of characters:
Uppercase Letters: A-Z
Lowercase Letters: a-z
Digits: 0-9

TASK2: Calculator
The GUI-based Calculator Project uses Python's Tkinter library to create a simple graphical user interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. 
The application features input fields for two numbers and buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Users can enter numbers into the input fields and click the respective operation button to see the result displayed in a read-only entry field. 
The calculator handles basic operations with appropriate error handling for division by zero. This project illustrates how to build a
user-friendly GUI application with Tkinter, showcasing essential concepts like event handling, widget layout, and user input management.

TASK3: Rock-paper-scissor Game
The Rock-Paper-Scissors Python Project is a straightforward command-line game where users play against the computer. 
In this project, players input their choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer's choice is generated randomly. 
The game then determines the winner based on the classic rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. 
The program displays the choices and results for each round, keeps track of the score, and allows users to play multiple rounds until they choose to quit.
This project is a practical way to practice basic Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

TASK4: Contact Book
The Contact Book Project is a command-line Python application designed to manage and organize contact information. It allows users to perform essential functions for
handling contacts, including adding, searching, updating, deleting, and listing contact details.
Key features:
Add Contacts: Users can input new contact details, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses, 
which are then stored in a data structure like a dictionary or a file.
Search Contacts: Users can search for contacts by name or other criteria to quickly retrieve specific information.
Update Contacts: Users can modify existing contact details, allowing them to keep their information current.
Delete Contacts: Users can remove contacts that are no longer needed, ensuring the contact list remains relevant and organized.
List Contacts: Users can view all saved contacts in a formatted list, with options to sort or filter the list based on specific criteria.
